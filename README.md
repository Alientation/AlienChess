# AlienChess
Old unfinished project, most likely doesn't work

Once the AlienGUI library has finished all major features development, I am willing to come back and rewrite using the library. (Java Swing was just giving me too hard of a time, stupid little overlay flickerin issue that my perfectionist self got so bothered by)
